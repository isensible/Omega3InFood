Hi Ed,

I am sorry if my replies to Cindy's e mails caused any additional issues.  I was in two minds about replying.  Part of me didn't want to get involved at all, but also I wanted to be honest and clear with Cindy.  I don't know what to believe about what she has said i.e. your addiction to the internet, an addiction to sex? Do you agree, are these actual issues for you?

Thank you for cancelling the Sky subscription.  I will make arrangements for the new contract.

Congrats on the new job. That is a really wonderful step towards building your life there. I hope that it does help you feel more settled. Also, great way to make friends.
Btw, what happened to you computers etc? You said that they got destroyed. Also, the internet restrictions sound a little, well restrictive. Feeling a bit confused is natural.  It sounds like a complicated and difficult environment.  Remember to look out for yourself and make choices that keep you in the centre.  At the end of the day you need to be happy. As long as you are happy in Australia then make things work.  There will be a way that it can work.

Clinchcon was really good.  I played lots of new games as well as a few classics e.g. Hive Mind. I lost my first game of Teriforming Mars.  Lost by about 3 points to Paul (Devon). It was a good game and well played by all. Lesson will be in January time. Should be fun. I have bought "Unlock; the adventures of Oz", "Sherlook" and also "Everdell". I played Everdell At Surbi and Joshi's house a while ago. I really enjoyed playing it so I had to buy it!

I will send a photo of the bathroom. 

I miss chatting with you sometimes. It is always good to have a friend that you can be yourself with.
